# Clustering WebApp

This is the source code and data for a clustering workshop for MedTech.

This will need you to have installed python, and a few other packages.

Once python is installed, type the following into your command line:

```pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```

This will install all the packages needed.

Download the completed code and data, making sure to put them into the same folder.
