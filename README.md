# Machine Learning Clustering WebApp

This is the source code and data for a clustering workshop for MedTech.

We will be using KMeans clustering algorithm. To find out more about it, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA).

This will need you to have installed python, and a few packages.

Please install python by visiting this page and following the install instructions:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once python is installed, copy/paste or type the following into your command line:

```pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```

This will install all the packages needed.

Download the completed code and data, making sure to put them into the same folder.
